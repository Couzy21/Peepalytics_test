Welcome to the backend infrastructure of the Peepalytics test application. This component is developed using Python 3.12, and is built on the robust Django Rest Framework.

For data management, we've opted to utilize POSTGRES as our database solution.

To set up and run this API, follow these steps:

Clone the designated backend branch from the repository.
Install the necessary dependencies listed in the 'requirements.txt' file within your virtual environment using pip.
Initiate the server by executing the command 'python manage.py runserver'. It will be hosted on port 8000.
Visit the base URL/api to confirm successful deployment.
All Endpoints can be tested on this live site https://peepalytics-test.onrender.com/swagger/
